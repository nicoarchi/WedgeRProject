# WEDGER PROJECT BACK-END

## WedgeR

The WedgeR Project was made for the Explorer Lab Youth with Solutions Program 2020, organised by Banco Santander & CISE in 2019.

### The Problem

Waste generation and low recycling rates are one of the main problems to solve since it will increase 70% by 2050. Nowadays we generate more than 2.01 billon tones of waste worldwide and this is only going to increase to 3.4 by 2050.

### The Solution

WedgeR is new disruptive waste management model that helps user recycle where the waste is generated. The solution is made out of: -An intelligent waste recycling module that uses an AI integrated software to identify, classify and automatically sort different types of waste, in their respective bins. -A cross platform that ingests data to give real time value analytics about consumption, waste generation among others. It creates user awareness and promotes better recycling behavior through gamification. We demolish the traditional ways of waste management and solve the recycling issue on the spot where the waste is generated. The Waste-EDGE-Recycling model will change the way we understand waste and recycling by promoting circular economy values. We are giving users a different outcome to their waste and so raising awareness of what can be done with efficient recycling.
